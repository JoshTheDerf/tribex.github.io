Standardize the colors a bit.\r\n * Streamline the demo/doc build process, auto-generate the demo index.html.\r\n * Clean up and comment Gruntfile.js.\r\n * Move docs and demos into gh-pages branch.\r\n * Consider the feasibility of adding a CodeAreaField using Ace or CodeMirror.\r\n * Add something akin to tabs, perhaps through layouts or a compound widget.\r\n * Add some sort of Table widget.\r\n * Add some sort of TreeView widget.\r\n\r\nNote that all of the above takes a backseat to a work project I'm developing, so I can't dedicate that much time to it.\r\n\r\nHow much do you guys use PhotonUI for?
